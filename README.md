# Movie-Recommender-Systems

This repositories contain different recommender systems applied on the famous MovieLens 20M dataset. It contains three repositories:
1. Content Based Filtering
2. Demographic Filtering
3. Collaborative Filtering

Demographic Filtering:
In the notebook I have applied weighted IMDB rating and recalculated scores of each movie and found the top scored movies. 
The results are as follows:

The top most scored movie is Shawshank Redemption, The (1994) with a  nice score of 4.43
Now let us apply content based filtering to it and find similar movies to it
The results for Content based filtering are:

Shanghai Triad (Yao a yao yao dao waipo qiao) ...
Dead Man Walking (1995)
Hate (Haine, La) (1995)

Heavenly Creatures (1994)
Little Odessa (1994)

Once Were Warriors (1994)

The above systems are not personal hence any user browsing them will receive the same recommendations
Let us improvise it by using Collaborative Filtering and lets say we want to recommend user 19 movies:
Top 10 Recommendations for UserId 19:
Independence Day (a.k.a. ID4) (1996)

Fargo (1996)
Mr. Holland's Opus (1995)
Broken Arrow (1996)
Birdcage, The (1996)
These are generated by our model and now lets compare the movies which user 19 rated the best

Do not worry if predicted top movies are not same as users top recommendations. Here, we completed the utility matrix and predicted which movies got highest rating. Based on particular user if the user has rated other movies which he did not rate previously, we now understand the user and estimated ratings he will give to new ones. May be some new movies which the user did not rate has got good ratings, hence we recommend those. 
Hence this system performs good at personalizing user preferences and understand him. 
Kudos, finally we are able to create a personalized system for users in our dataset.
