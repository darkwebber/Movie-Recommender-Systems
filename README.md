# Movie-Recommender-Systems

This repositories contain different recommender systems applied on the famous MovieLens 20M dataset. It contains different recommender systems right from content based filtering to neural Collaborative filtering. I have modified the problem statement for some systems and also tried recommendations using implicit data.

Atlast we can compare results obtained from different recommender systems and check their quality of recommendtions.
